# icecreamPCA

Created for the Women in Data Science ATX meetup, 9/29/16.  This workshop is
focused on exploring dimensionality reduction through PCA and SVD.  

IceCreamData.ipynb - Randomly generate a sample of ice cream sundae combinations.
Output is IceCreamSundaes.csv.

icecreamPCA.ipynb - Workbook for exploring the IceCreamSundaes.csv data set,
and performing principal component analysis.  The overall objectives include
deciding how many dimensions to reduce to, how to perform the coordinate transformation
and reconstruct the data using the principal components, and how to interpret the
principal components to inform data mining and predictive modeling efforts.
